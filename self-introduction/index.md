Hi! My name is Sergey, and I'm delighted to welcome you today. I'm a student at Rs School and I’m studying frontend development. Today, I would like to share my story with you about how I came into this exciting profession.
My journey into the world of programming started long before I joined Rs School. Even during my school years, I acquired my first basic programming skills in Pascal. It was really interesting and exiting. I was enchanted by the prОcess of exploration and creating new algorithms, as well as witnessing how computer programs turn into functioning prОcesses. I learned to write simple programs, use variables, conditional statements, and loops. Each new task was a puzzle for me, and I enjoyed solving it.
This initial programming experience became the foundation for my continued interest in programming and inspired me to explore other programming languages and technologies. I realized that programming is not only a fascinating activity but also an indispensable tool for solving various tasks in the modern world.
However, when it came time to choose a profession, I decided to become a civil engineer. At that time, the construction industry in Belarus was booming, and I enrolled in the Belarusian National Technical University. There, I specialized in industrial and civil construction, and after graduating, I worked for over seven years as a foreman, site supervisor, and project manager.
Initially, I enjoyed this work. I gained valuable experience in organizing construction production, building relationships within teams, solving complex integrated tasks, and managing long-term projects. However, the construction industry is relatively slow to evolve, especially in Belarus. Most of the technologies used are from the previous century.
Over time, I began to realize that I wasn't growing professionally. Each new day was similar to the previous one, and year after year, I found myself doing the same things. That's why I decided to change my profession. Remembering my passion for programming during my school years and the enjoyment I derived from it, I decided to try myself in the IT field.
I chose frontend development because it's important for me to see the results of my work. I started searching the internet for information about various courses that teach frontend development and came across RS School. What appealed to me was the six-month duration of the course, the curriculum filled with various relevant technologies, and practical assignments.
However, since I had to balance my studies at Rs School with work and had no basic knowledge in frontend development when the course started, I couldn't pass stage 1 on my first attempt in spring 2022. The virtual keyboard task seemed impossible for me at that time.
Therefore, during the summer, I started studying at stage 0. The pace of learning there was not as intense, and newcomers could gradually familiarize themselves and acquire the necessary basic knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git, as well as the skills for successful completion of further studies.
Unfortunately, due to personal reasons, I couldn't continue my studies in stage 1 in autumn 2022, and I had to postpone it until this spring. Now I have the opportunity to dedicate all my time to learning without any distractions. The foundational knowledge I gained in stage 0 is helping me progress through the course more easily and successfully.
By the way this time, exactly the virtual keyboard task seemed the most interesting to me, and I successfully completed it. Its implementation required solidifying my knowledge of working with the DOM, learning about keyboard events, and working with LocalStorage.
I'm glad to have found a community like RS School, where people help each other learn, engage in mentorship, and are always ready to answer all your questions in detail. I genuinely enjoy what I'm doing right now. You open an empty file in a code editor, and after a few hours, your thoughts come to life on the screen. Isn't it magical? And I really want to make a living doing exactly this.
I'm confident that thanks to the RS School community and the help of mentors, I will be able to successfully complete the course and acquire the knowledge and skills that will help me find my dream job.
Thank you for your attention. Have a good day!
